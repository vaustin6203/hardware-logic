# CPU -ALU and Regfile
A group project where we implemented a RISC-V CPU using Logisim. Implemented ALU functions including add, and, or, xor, srl, sra, sll, slt, divu, remu, mul, mulhu, sub, bsel, and mulh. 
Implemented 9 of the 32 RISC-V architecture registers. Designed and created the logic for the processor, memory unit, and control unit. Also added additional optimizations using pipelining, where we implemented a 2-stage pipeline design.
Using Logisim, you can actually have this CPU run code!
